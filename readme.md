## CLUTCH: Car Listings and User-Targeted Competitive Holdings

## Overview
CLUTCH is a mobile application designed to revolutionize the online vehicle auction and sales process. Our goal is to simplify the buying and selling of used cars by integrating auction elements, thus making the process more engaging and transparent. This project is inspired by the limitations of traditional vehicle auctions and the success of existing online platforms like Carousell and Carro.

## Project Background
The automotive industry is increasingly leaning towards online platforms for vehicle transactions. Traditional methods, including physical auctions, pose challenges like time consumption, limited outreach, and lack of transparency. CLUTCH addresses these issues by offering a user-friendly mobile application for online vehicle auctions.

## Objectives
- Develop a smartphone application for easy selling and buying of used cars.
- Ensure rigorous inspections of cars to prevent falsification of features.
- Implement a cancellation fee mechanism to discourage buyer fraud.
- Introduce auction features to add competitiveness and desirability to car listings.

## Literature Review
We analyzed several platforms and technologies including:
- Carousell for its simplicity in selling/buying used goods.
- Carro for its comprehensive ecosystem and success in the Southeast Asian used car marketplace.
- Online auction types, focusing on English and Penny auctions.
- Git for version control.
- Jira for project management.
- GitHub for collaborative software development.
- Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) phases.
- Frontend and Backend development processes.

## Design and Implementation
We took inspiration from Carousell's accessibility and Carro's professional design. Key design considerations include:
- Colour Palette: A mix of blue (#0077B5) and green (#00A859) to symbolize trust, positivity, and dynamism.
- Typography: Usage of Roboto font for readability and versatility.
- Icons: Vector-based for scalability and adaptability.
- Mascot: A blue rabbit with wheels, symbolizing speed and innovation.

## Conceptual Stages
- Initial Stage: Problem analysis, target audience identification, and tool selection.
- Designing Phase: Drafting wireframes and selecting software tools like Figma, MERN stack, MongoDB, React Native, Node.js, and AWS.
- Development Phase: Frontend (React Native) and Backend (Express and Node.Js)

## Features
- Shop/Listing: Easy access to car brands, popular listings, and detailed product pages.
- Auction: Facilitates efficient vehicle liquidation and buying process with transparent auction mechanics.

## System Architecture
- Database Design: Models for User, Items, Auction, and Transaction.
- API Design: Endpoints for managing cars, users, auctions, and transactions.
- Deployment: Utilization of MongoDB Atlas, AWS Serverless API, and AWS Authentication.

## Frontend Implementation
- Folder Structure: Divided into 'frontend' and 'assets'.
- Page Routing: Detailed routing for tabs like Home, Listing, Auction, Chat, and Profile.
- Component Development: Use of React components and customized components for UI development.
- Integration: Connection of frontend and backend through asynchronous JavaScript.

## Conclusion and Recommendations
The project, despite its challenges, successfully achieved its goals within a 14-week timeframe. Future recommendations include incorporating data analytics, cybersecurity protocols, and AI for vehicle recommendations.
