This currently is Version 1.2 of the items list code, with functioning react.js but only 1 page 
The .env file is hidden, i think it can be downloaded, if unable, i dump it the base text into a text file

Functionality:
1. Getting the list for both sold and all
2. updating the entry
3. Adding the entry
4. Modular Code
5. now react.js exist

Bugs:
1. For some reason, getting sold while there isnt a sold option, just results in a blank page (Ignored - not actually a problem)

Future Functionality:
1. Sort by person looking it up (Short)
2. Temp React App (Short) (completed)
3. Full Temp React App (Medium)

Potential Issues:
1. Images has to be stored in binary, changing from images to binary and back is going to be pain (Solution from external API)

libraries used:
1. node.js
2. dotenv
3. express.js
4. mongodb
5. mongoose
