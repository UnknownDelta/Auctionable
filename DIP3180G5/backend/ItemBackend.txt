This currently is Version 1 of the items list code, currently no functioning react.js

Functionality:
1. Getting the list for both sold and all
2. updating the entry
3. Adding the entry
4. Modular Code

Bugs:
1. For some reason, getting sold while there isnt a sold option, just results in a blank page

Future Functionality:
1. Sort by person looking it up (Short)
2. Temp React App (Medium)

Potential Issues:
1. Images has to be stored in binary, changing from images to binary and back is going to be pain
